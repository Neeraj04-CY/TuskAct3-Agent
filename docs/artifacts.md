# Artifact Guide

Every demo run produces a self-contained folder (for example `docs/artifacts/heroku_sample/`). Use the table below to know what to inspect.

| File | Description | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run_summary.json` | Raw Strategist + Worker completion payload. | Shows the goal, completion reason, duration, and reward counters. |
| `run_summary.md` / `run_summary.pdf` | Human-readable briefing generated by `scripts/generate_run_summary.py`. | Perfect for YC reviewers; highlights planner changes, repairs, screenshots, and behavior predictions. |
| `stability_report.json` / `stability_report.md` | Output from `StabilityMonitor` with reward drift, confidence trend, repair pressure, and DOM similarity. | Demonstrates that the agent is learning across runs and surfaces regressions immediately. |
| `steps.jsonl` | Strategist step metadata in chronological order. | Lets you replay the planner decisions or diff future runs. |
| `trace.jsonl` | Worker telemetry (navigate/fill/click/screenshot). | Confirms that dry-run mode still recorded each action. |
| `step_*/` folders | DOM snapshots, layout graphs, screenshots, and patched selectors per step. | Visual proof for each page transition; `layout_graph.json` shows the structural parse. |
| `result.json` | High-level BrowserWorker transcript identical to the JSON viewer. | Quick way to share the plan with someone who just wants the action list. |

**Navigation tips**

1. Start with `run_summary.md` for the story, then open `trace.jsonl` if you need timestamps.
2. Screenshots sit inside every `step_XXX/` directory; copy them directly into slide decks.
3. Behavior predictions are appended to `run_summary.json` under `run_context.behavior_predictions` — mention them to demonstrate closed-loop learning.
